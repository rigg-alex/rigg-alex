## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Data Analyst and PhD Candidate with experience in data science, education, and research. Iâ€™ve worked on developing PowerBI dashboards and leading analytical projects aimed at improving student outcomes. My PhD research focuses on population dynamics of vagrant tropical fish, where I use tools like RStudio, Python, and PRIMER PERMANOVA to analyse ecological data.

In my roles, Iâ€™ve led efforts to standardize data processes and provided training to improve data literacy among staff, helping them make better decisions. I aim to apply my analytical skills in ways that make a lasting, practical difference in both education and ecology.
